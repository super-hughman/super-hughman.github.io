Starting in 2019, I worked as a developer and lab technician at [Cyclikal](https://cyclikal.com/), a company providing high precision calorimetry testing for lithium-ion batteries.

My work focused on developing the [Cyckei](https://docs.cyclikal.com/projects/cyckei/en/stable/) software package which automates voltage and current steps and data handling while cycling li-ion cells. Older versions of the software and accompanying tools are open source and [available on GitHub](https://github.com/cyclikal/cyckei).

## Hobby Components

I have explored manufacturing small components with 3D printing and manual machining techniques. Some of these projects are bicycle related and stem from issues I have run into while working as a professional mechanic, while others are just fun opportunities to practice designing and fabricating various objects.

Pictured are a selection of items I've made including machined aluminum top caps for bike cockpits, a front light and GoPro compatible mount, and some bits that help with common bike repairs such as hydraulic brake caliper service and bleeding.
